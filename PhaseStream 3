PhaseStream 3

    The aliens have learned the stupidity of their misunderstanding of Kerckhoffs’s principle.
    Now they’re going to use a well-known stream cipher (AES in CTR mode) with a strong key. And they’ll happily give us poor humans the source because they’re so confident it’s secure!


Challenge

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util import Counter
import os

KEY = os.urandom(16)


def encrypt(plaintext):
    cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=Counter.new(128))
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    return ciphertext.hex()


test = b"No right of private conversation was enumerated in the Constitution. I don't suppose it occurred to anyone at the time that it could be prevented."
print(encrypt(test))

with open('flag.txt', 'rb') as f:
    flag = f.read().strip()
print(encrypt(flag))
