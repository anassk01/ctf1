PhaseStream
Author: Hyperreality

    The aliens are trying to build a secure cipher to encrypt all our games called “PhaseStream”. They’ve heard that stream ciphers are pretty good.
    The aliens have learned of the XOR operation which is used to encrypt a plaintext with a key. They believe that XOR using a repeated 5-byte key is enough to build a strong stream cipher. Such silly aliens!
    Here’s a flag they encrypted this way earlier. Can you decrypt it (hint: what’s the flag format?)
